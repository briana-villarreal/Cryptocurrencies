# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze a database of cryptocurrencies using unsupervised machine learning. A report is then created to include traded cryptocurrencies, which are classified by groups according to their specific features. This report can be used by an investment bank to propose new cryptocurrency investment opportunities for their clients. To provide this report, I preprocessed the database, reduced the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis, clustered cryptocurrencies using K-Means, and visualized classification results with scatter plots.
